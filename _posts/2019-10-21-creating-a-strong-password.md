Building a strong password is all about length and mixing it up with letters, numbers, special characters.  Having a strong password will save you from the headache of getting hacked.

## First let’s see how strong your password is
Take a look at [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net) to see if your existing password is strong.  You may not need to read the rest of this cause you’re ahead of the game if your password is strong.  

## Weak to Strong
Let’s take a look at how we can make a weak password into a strong password.

| Note | Password | How fast it will be cracked |
| :------------- | :------- | ------------: |
| starting password | monkey | instantly |
| add some numbers | monkey123 | 42 minutes |
| add a capital letter | Monkey123 | 4 days |
| add some symbols | !!Monkey123 | 400 years |
| more ~~cowbell~~ symbols | !!Monkey123!! | 4 Billion years |
| add another word | !!Monkey123!!Love | 93 Trillion years |

## I have a strong password
Great!!! Now you know how to create a strong password and it’s time to look at a Password Manager so you only have to create 1 strong password instead of hundreds of them.  See my blog post on [*Password Managers* ](/password-managers),

TLDR;
Use numbers, letters, symbols and make it over 16 characters long

Please don’t use `monkey` as your password, it’s one of the most common passwords out there right next to `password` and `123456`
